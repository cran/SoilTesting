\title{Mineral N i.e., summation of ammonium-N and nitrate-N in soil}
\usage{
Mineral_N(W = W, m = m, VA = VA, VE = VE, VS = VS, VB = VB, X = X)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{Mass of moist soil sample (g)}

\item{m}{Moisture content of the field-moist soil sample (\% w/w)}

\item{VA}{Volume of aliquot of the extract (mL) taken for distillation}

\item{VE}{Volume of 2 M KCl (mL) added as extractant}

\item{VS}{Volume of standard sulphuric acid solution (mL) consumed in titration with soil}

\item{VB}{Volume of standard sulphuric acid solution (mL) consumed in titration without soil (i.e., blank titration)}

\item{X}{Normality of standard sulphuric acid solution}
}
\value{
N_mgkg - Mineral N in soil (mg/kg) (expressed in terms of oven-dried soil mass)
}
\description{
This function determines the amount of mineral N (ammonium-N + nitrate-N) in soil as extracted by 2 M KCl, expressed in terms of oven-dried soil mass (Rowell, 1994).
}
\details{
Mineral N in soil consists of ammonium and nitrate ions present on soil exchange sites or solution or both. It can be extracted by 2 M KCl. The extract is steam-distilled in the presence of magnesium oxide and Devardaâ€™s alloy (Cu: Al: Zn :: 50: 45: 5) to liberate ammonia. The evolved ammonia is absorbed in 2\% boric acid solution containing mixed indicator, pH 4.5, and titrated against standard sulphuric acid solution to know the volume of the boric acid consumed during ammonia absorption (Rowell, 1994; Biswas, 2018).
